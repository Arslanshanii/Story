Output: . Exercise 01: This is the exercise text. Task 1: Write the definition of Ohm's Law. Answer: Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided the temperature remains constant. Solution Tables . For solutions requiring tables, use the solutiontable environment. Tables are numbered sequentially for each exercise (e.g., “Solution Table 1.1”, “Solution Table 1.2”). Example: . \\begin{solutiontable} \\centering \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline Voltage (V) &amp; Current (A) &amp; Resistance ($\\Omega$) \\\\ \\hline 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\hline 10 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\caption{Ohm's Law values.} \\end{solutiontable} . Solution Figures . To add solution-specific figures, use the solutionfigure environment. Figures are also numbered sequentially (e.g., “Solution Figure 1.1”). Example: . \\begin{solutionfigure} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{ohms_law_plot.png} \\caption{Voltage vs. Current graph.} \\end{solutionfigure} . Automatic Numbering for Equations, Figures, and Tables . Equations, figures, and tables,tasks and subtaks are automatically numbered based on the exercise. For example, the first equation in “Exercise 01” is numbered as “(1.1)”. Example: . \\begin{equation} V = I \\cdot R \\end{equation} . Output: . (1.1) V = I ⋅ R . Graphics Support .
